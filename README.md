# CoffeeMachine
Simple coffee machine coded in python3 demonstrating use of Classes

This is ran via the Terminal.  You will be prompted to either 
  buy coffee, 
  fill the coffee machine when things run low, 
  take the money, 
  show current inventory and 
  exit.

Follow the prompts which run through a menu system.

Project was intended as a demonstration of the usefulness of Classes to contruct a template for the coffee machine to operate.
